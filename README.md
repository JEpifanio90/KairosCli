# KairosCli ‚è≥

**Kairos** (Pronounced: /Ààka…™r…ís/, *KY-ross*) is an ancient Greek concept referring to the "opportune" or "right" moment.

**Unleash the optimal state of your codebase with intelligent linting.**

### ‚ú® **Why KairosCli?**

In large, complex codebases, adopting and maintaining consistent linting standards is a constant battle. Developers at all levels grapple with:

* ü§î **The "Best Practices" Guessing Game:** What are the truly optimal linting rules for *my* project? How do I keep them updated with the latest community standards and security recommendations?
* üöß **Overwhelming Legacy Code:** How do I introduce stricter rules without drowning my team in thousands of new errors and warnings?
* üìâ **Stagnant Code Quality:** Linting configurations often become outdated, leading to accumulating technical debt and inconsistent coding styles.

**KairosCli solves this.** It's your personal AI-powered code quality strategist, bringing clarity, consistency, and a clear path forward for your codebase.

### üöÄ **Features (Currently Building - CLI First!)**

* **Intelligent Rule Recommendation:** KairosCli analyzes your existing JS/TS codebase (considering frameworks, patterns, dependencies, and even historical commit data) and leverages an advanced AI to recommend a tailored ESLint configuration, going far beyond generic presets.
* **Flexible Strictness Tiers:** You set the pace! Apply rules based on your desired strictness (Low, Mid, High) ‚Äì KairosCli intelligently balances warnings vs. errors to avoid overwhelming your team, especially when tackling large legacy projects.
* **Actionable Improvement Roadmaps:** For stricter configurations, KairosCli doesn't just highlight problems; it generates a clear, prioritized roadmap within your `README.md`. This guide helps your team systematically address technical debt and gradually tighten standards.
* **Fast & Reliable (Rust-Powered):** Built with Rust, KairosCli is designed for blazing-fast analysis, ensuring quick feedback cycles even on massive codebases.
* **Open-Source Core:** The foundational CLI is open-source, fostering transparency, community contributions, and robust development. We believe in building in the open.

### üéØ **The Kairos Vision (Future & Paid Features)**

While we're starting with a powerful open-source CLI, the long-term vision for Kairos includes:

* **Advanced AI Analysis & Custom Rule Generation:** Deeper AI insights to suggest hyper-specific rules, automatically detect unique anti-patterns, and even generate custom linting rules based on natural language input.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Seamless, powerful integration into your build pipelines for automated quality gates, performance tracking, and streamlined reporting.
* **Enterprise Dashboard & Centralized Management:** A web-based platform for engineering leadership to manage rules centrally across multiple teams, track code quality trends over time, and gain executive-level insights into codebase health.
* **Multi-language Support:** Expanding Kairos's intelligence beyond JavaScript/TypeScript to other popular languages like Rust, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, Php, etc...
